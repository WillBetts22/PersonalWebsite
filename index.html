          <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces the geometry and linear-algebraic structure of quadratic forms, focus
          ing on their symmetric matrix representation, orthogonal diagonalization, definiteness, and role
          in optimization. We reinterpret classical identities of Diophantus, Brahmagupta, Euler,
          and Degen as compositions of quadratic forms, leading to the Hurwitz-Radon theorem. The paper also extends these concepts to cubic norm forms and explores applications in statistics. [cite: 358, 359]
